KVInit is a simple tool (at the present) that will help create persistent maps based (currently) in
MapDb that may prove useful staging them for Pmml Model access via the EnvContext object found
in all models.

See the source code for some ideas on where this tool could take you in your effort to 
drive code access in a table driven way.
